    "Our goal is take a sentence with a missing word -- \n",
    " for example \"Mary eats a \\_\", and replace the blank with a 'reasonable' replacement word.\n",
    "This task is something that people do everyday, especially in a noisy setting or when speaking to someone with a thick accent. \n",
    "However, this task goes beyond just syntactic validity, since few people would guess that the sentence was 'Mary eats a laptop'. We need to inject some notion of semantics. However, we cannot just naively apply methods from WordNet, because we are missing the word that fits in the blank. Most WordNet methods are ways of mapping from one word to other words that are related in a particular way, eg hypernymy or synonymy. \n",
    "\n",
    "So in order to move forward, we should first come up with a way of distinguishing valid sentences in a way that lets us generate a missing word. We decided to adopt a model of language learning that is very similar to the notion of near-miss learning. We take a set of training sentences, use software from lab 3 to convert them into event structures, and group event structures together in a way that lets us generalize semantically valid sentences from our training data. This means that we are assuming that the training data is semantically valid. \n",
