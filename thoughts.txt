 add_fact
 print_knowledge
 yesno_query 
 wh_query

Longer term, make the check in lang query be from the database
For testing just make a method 

Use the provided lexicon as the possible words that can go in a slot

Want training stage
 python semantic.py <-- create db
  just start with indicative sentences
 play around with that db

Actually do not want the REPL interface
Just use input file

Pomo 1: 10:55 - 11:20
Goal: Get the first 1-diff pass working

Printing hi
 means not merged

Too many print statements making difficult to interpret

Going into not merged for each sentence
Not adding after each
Make so only one examples

Currently not merging properly
Got rid of extra semantic category feature
Check if merged clause being entered now
 was an ordering problem
 Now merging properly

Pomo 2: 11:20 - 11:45
Goal: Group expansion via shared hypernymy
